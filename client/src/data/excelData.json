All naming convention aside the beer has not changed significantly since its release in 2014.  As part of the Four Winds' Zephyrus series of beers The Juxtapose Wild IPA is available in 650ml bottles as well as on tap in select BC based locations. The beer pours from the bottle a slightly cloudy, amber colour with three very thick fingers of head. The smell is hoppy with a northwest pine to it and delicious tropical fruit notes. Mango and pineapple tones add to the piney, northwest hop to make for a mid-sweet, moderately hopped IPA. The Brett, or Wild portion of the beer gives the Juxtapose a slight yeasty-ness to it which Four Winds dubs as Brett funk' while also giving an earthy heartiness to the brew. The flavour is a combination of tropical fruit flavours, northwest style hops, a slight wheatiness and again that Brett funk' which livens up the flavours. Funk is not a bad thing here as along side the fruit and hop flavours it simply adds an extra dimension to a delicious ale. The Juxtapose is truly unique and a fantastic representation of what can be done in blending international traditions with unique BC beer styles. This beer may be hard to find but it is worth the hunt!",
